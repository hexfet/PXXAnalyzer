# PXX Protocol Analyzer
A Salae Logic analyzer plugin for decoding Frsky PXX protocol data.

To use the PXX Analyzer in Windows download the dll here(TODO).  Add the file to the default Salae Logic analyzers directory (likely C:\Program Files\Saleae Inc\Analyzers).  Start Logic and PXX should appear in the analyzers list.

The analyzer decodes the PXX byte values. Sampled bits are marked with a dot, while bits ignored due to bit stuffing are marked with X.

For linux or Mac OS please build from source. See the directions at [https://github.com/saleae/AnalyzerSDK](https://github.com/saleae/AnalyzerSDK)
